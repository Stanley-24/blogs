Most of my days are spent learning, writing code, thinking in logic — building systems that solve problems.  
But then there are days when I do nothing.  
Days when I can’t even open my computer.  
When my thoughts get clouded by the material things around me, and the noise in my head turns negative.  

It was during one of those low cycles that I found **The Kybalion** — and it completely shifted the way I see life.

## The Awakening

The book opened my eyes to a powerful truth:  
> *“The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental.”*  

Everything we experience begins first as a thought.  
We become what we think, what we do, and what we continuously feed our inner world.

I realized that within me exist two forces — the **I** and the **Me**.

- The **I** is the directive will — the conscious creator.  
- The **Me** is the reactive mind — shaped by emotions, memory, and environment.  

To bring ideas to life, the *I* must impregnate the *Me* — just as the masculine and feminine come together on the physical plane to reproduce creation.  
The *I* gives direction; the *Me* gives form.  
That union is what manifests reality.

## The Seven Hermetic Principles and the Mind as a System

The seven Hermetic principles became my debugging guide for the mind — each one reflecting something I use daily as a software engineer.

1. **Mentalism** – All is mind. My thoughts are the blueprint.  
2. **Correspondence** – “As above, so below.” My inner code reflects in my outer system.  
3. **Vibration** – Nothing rests. My thoughts are frequencies that attract their match.  
4. **Polarity** – Light and dark, success and failure — all part of one spectrum.  
5. **Rhythm** – Everything flows. Some days are for coding; others for stillness.  
6. **Cause and Effect** – Every thought triggers a reaction. I’m both the cause and the result.  
7. **Gender** – Creation needs balance — logic and intuition, giving and receiving, *I* and *Me*.

## Coding Life Itself

As a software engineer, I now see coding as a metaphor for living:

- Every **thought** is a line of code.  
- Every **belief** is a function.  
- Every **outcome** is just the program running exactly as written.  

Even on the days I feel low, I remind myself:  
The **I** in me requested this life.  
The **Me** must learn to align with it.  

I may not have much in the physical world yet — but mentally, I’m already building the structure of everything I’ll one day live.

## Reflection

When was the last time you caught your *I* trying to reprogram your *Me*?
