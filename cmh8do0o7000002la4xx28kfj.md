## 🧩 My LinkedIn Journey

In **February 2024**, I joined the **LinkedIn Blue app community** and simultaneously began my journey to become a **software developer**.

I was just a young boy wandering through the internet, trying to find something meaningful to do with my life and youth. Joining [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanley-owarieta/) opened a new world for me. I began connecting with amazing individuals — **developers, recruiters, founders, solopreneurs, and mentees** — each interaction teaching me something new every time I logged in.

## 🔐 My Verification Struggle

One day, I came across a post explaining how to **verify your LinkedIn authenticity** using a valid **international passport**. I tried several times, but LinkedIn’s system couldn’t detect the **chip** it was looking for inside my passport.

At first, I thought the problem was my passport — maybe something was wrong with it. What I didn’t know was that the real issue was with my **iPhone**, which apparently isn’t **NFC-enabled** for that type of passport scan.

This became one of my biggest frustrations with LinkedIn verification. I had all the right documents, but couldn’t get verified.

## 💡 The Turning Point

Fast forward to yesterday — I came across a powerful post by [**Abdulrafiu Izuafa**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdulrafiu-izuafa-a9a451264_networking101-linkedintips-verifiedprofiles-activity-7387008606409469952-mdCv?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAEwZ5B4BLr4PQK3vjq_vpJntrlT8sLe9mOQ), an **AI & Community leader, Microsoft MVP, and AI/ML Architect**, where he shared something he called **Networking 101**.

He said:

> “Only connect with people who have a verified LinkedIn profile.  
> This isn’t about being picky; it’s about protecting your network from scammers and impersonators.”

That post hit me deeply. I realized how important authenticity is in a professional network. It inspired me to try verifying my account one more time.

## ⚙️ The Simple Trick That Worked

So I decided to give it another go.  
First, I tried again with my **iPhone** — same old error.

Then, something told me to **switch devices**.  
I picked up my **Samsung Android phone**, retried the verification process… and in **less than four minutes**, my [**LinkedIn profile**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanley-owarieta) **was verified** using my international passport!

No errors. No stress. Just smooth verification on the first try.

## 🙌 Gratitude

I’m grateful to [**Abdulrafiu Izuafa**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulrafiu-izuafa-a9a451264) for that motivating post,  
to [**Samsung**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/samsung-electronics/) for saving the day,  
and of course, to [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/) for creating a platform where authenticity and trust really matter.

## 🌍 Final Thoughts

Sometimes, the difference between frustration and success is just a **simple switch** in tools, mindset, or approach.

If you’ve been struggling to verify your LinkedIn account, try using an **Android phone** (especially one with NFC enabled). That small change might be all it takes to get verified.

Stay authentic, keep learning, and keep growing your network with real, trustworthy people. 💙
