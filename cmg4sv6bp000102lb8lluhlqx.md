Artificial Intelligence is everywhere â€” from [code generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_generation) to [customer support](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-support-vs-customer-service/#:~:text=Customer%20support%20is%20the%20team%20of%20people%20who%20provide%20help,your%20business%20to%20help%20solve.). But hereâ€™s the truth: **one AI accident could cost a company millions.**

Thatâ€™s not an exaggeration. I recently had a powerful conversation with my mentor, an experienced software engineer, to have an honest conversation about the new era of AI. What follows is a raw, no-fluff interview that uncovers the *opportunities* and *risks* every engineer and business leader should know.

### Q1: Why do you say AI could cost companies millions?

**Mentor:** [AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence) is expensive â€” from the cost of running it to the cost of monitoring it. But the bigger danger is misuse. One bad recommendation, one wrong model decision, or one careless data leak can derail a company. Imagine a [financial AI system](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence-finance) making the wrong prediction or a [healthcare AI](https://www.foreseemed.com/artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare) misdiagnosing a patient â€” thatâ€™s millions lost in lawsuits, operations, and trust.

### Q2: So should companies even bother with AI then?

**Mentor:** Absolutely. But they need to see it as a *tool*, not a replacement. Right now, AI is an [inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference) machine â€” it recognizes patterns and infers what comes next. Itâ€™s powerful for small tasks but not reliable enough to handle entire projects or mission-critical work.

### Q3: Can you give some examples of where AI actually helps?

**Mentor:**

* Summarizing documentation or research.
    
* Generating commit messages.
    
* Brainstorming ideas or unblocking a stuck thought process.
    
* Assisting in code reviews â€” though itâ€™s far from perfect.
    

These are in-between tasks. AI speeds things up, but the human brain still makes the final call.

### Q4: What about risks? What incidents should engineers watch out for?

**Mentor:** The risks are everywhere.

* **Wrong outputs** â€“ an incorrect line of code or suggestion.
    
* **Bias** â€“ models reflect the flaws in their training data.
    
* **Over-dependence** â€“ teams that rely too much on AI stop thinking critically.
    
* **Data exposure** â€“ sending sensitive data to an AI model without guardrails.
    

I use these models daily, and trust me â€” they misbehave every hour. If you donâ€™t watch them closely, theyâ€™ll break something important, He said.

### Q5: If you could go back and start your engineering career again, would you use AI differently?

**Mentor:** Iâ€™d use it like Google Search. A learning aid, not a crutch. Iâ€™d let it help with speed â€” summarizing, small documentation, maybe code snippets. But Iâ€™d never outsource real engineering thinking to AI. Not for junior work, and certainly not for senior-level decisions.

## Final Thoughts

AI is shaping a new era of work. It can accelerate learning, speed up repetitive tasks, and open new creative doors. But without caution, the cost of one mistake could erase all the benefits.

So hereâ€™s the takeaway:  
ðŸ‘‰ Use AI as a **co-pilot, not the pilot.** Respect its power, but donâ€™t forget its flaws.

Because in todayâ€™s fast-moving world, **one AI accident could cost a company millions.**
